# Code Prebuilt

Code Prebuilt is a prebuilt binary of the [Code - OSS](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) with some modifications, such as the addition of custom editor apis, and the removal of some telemetry and tracking. You can find the different patches, we apply to the codebase in the `patches` directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This should not be used as your main editor, instead use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) if you want an open source version of VSCode without Microsoft

## Acknowledgements

This project is based on the [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) and their setup scripts. We use their scripts with some slight modifications to build Code Prebuilt.
