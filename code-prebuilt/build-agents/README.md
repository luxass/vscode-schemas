# Build Agents

This directory contains the build agents that are used to build the code-prebuilt project.

It is a fork of [microsoft/vscode-linux-build-agent](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-linux-build-agent) with some modifications such as pushing to [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry) instead of [ACR](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-registry/).
